# 🧱 usechunk — The Open Modding Platform

Chunk is an open-source, ad-free ecosystem that makes installing, managing, and building modded Minecraft simple, reliable, and fast.

Where existing platforms focus on hosting mods, **Chunk focuses on orchestrating them**.  
We integrate seamlessly with Modrinth, CurseForge, GitHub Releases, and private mod sources—  
all through one clean, unified toolset.

## 🚀 What We're Building

### **[Chunk CLI](https://github.com/usechunk/chunk-cli)**
A powerful, developer-friendly command-line tool for installing mods, managing modpacks, and automating mod workflows.  
Think *Homebrew for Minecraft mods*.

### **[Chunk App](https://github.com/usechunk/chunk-app)**
A simple, lightweight GUI for browsing mods, installing packs, and managing your Minecraft instances—  
without ads, bloat, or a heavy client.

### **[ChunkHub Registry](https://github.com/usechunk/chunk-api)**
A metadata registry for Chunkfiles (like formulas) that describe mods, modpacks, dependencies, and installation logic.  
We **don't host mod files** — we reference Modrinth, CurseForge, GitHub, or any other source.

## 🌱 Our Philosophy

### **Open Source First**
All core components—CLI, API, App—are fully open source.  
We invite the community to build with us, not around us.

### **Ad-Free Forever**
No ads. Ever.  
Chunk is funded through optional premium tools, cloud sync, and creator-focused features—never through user attention or platform lock-in.

### **Creator Empowerment**
Chunk is designed for modders and modpack authors:
- Automated dependency resolution  
- Modpack diffing & debugging  
- Server-ready exports  
- Publishing pipelines  

Creators should spend time making great content, not fighting tooling.

## ✨ Why Chunk?

Other platforms host mods.  
Chunk **connects them**.

We unify Modrinth, CurseForge, GitHub Releases, and private mods into a single workflow:

```bash
chunk install my-modpack
chunk doctor
chunk build
chunk deploy
```
